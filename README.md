## ðŸ§ª LLM-Powered API Tester
A natural-language-driven API testing tool that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify the process of writing and running HTTP API tests. Instead of writing test cases manually, just describe what you want â€” and the system takes care of the rest.

## ðŸš€ Project Goal
Build an AI-powered testing tool where you can say things like:

> "Test this API, it should return 200 with this token."

> "Test this API with this token, it should include 5 items in the response."

The LLM interprets these natural language instructions and performs the appropriate HTTP requests, validating the responses accordingly.


## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
Writing and maintaining traditional API tests can be time-consuming. This tool aims to bring the power of natural language and LLMs to streamline testing workflows â€” especially useful for QA engineers, backend devs, and rapid prototyping.
